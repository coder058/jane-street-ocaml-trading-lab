# Jane Street OCaml Trading Lab

An auditable live market monitor and **Alpaca paper-only** execution experiment,
written in OCaml. This is an independent portfolio project, not affiliated with
Jane Street or Alpaca. It does not claim a profitable strategy.

**Live read-only monitor:** [jane-street-paper-monitor.vercel.app](https://jane-street-paper-monitor.vercel.app/)

The Dublin VPS runs an OCaml paper order service and an Alpaca US market-data
collector. It signs a sanitized broker and journal
snapshot for Vercel; no Alpaca secret is sent to the website. The dashboard
shows BTC bot orders, fills, position and decision traces. It excludes other
account holdings and equity. The current result subtracts posted USD crypto
fees and uses the broker BTC mark; it stays provisional until daily fee
posting, BTC quantity and closed-lot reconciliation are complete.

A second, read-only collector records public Hyperliquid HIP-3 prices, BBOs and
1m candle updates for selected FX-like, index, energy and equity contracts.
It cannot access a wallet or submit orders. Its capture and restart behavior
are documented in [the Hyperliquid feed runbook](docs/HYPERLIQUID-CAPTURE.md).
This is market-data collection, not a claim that the OCaml executor is HFT.

## Current behavior

- The Dublin collector archives Alpaca US BTC/USD WebSocket quotes, trades,
  order books, closed-minute bars and later bar revisions with receipt times.
  It also archives quotes and minute bars for a 15-pair crypto research
  watchlist selected from paper assets and a same-day data-coverage scan.
  Only BTC quotes and bars reach OCaml over the local Unix socket; the other
  pairs cannot trigger orders. The [multi-asset research boundary](docs/MULTI-ASSET-RESEARCH.md)
  records the measured market catalog and five requested timeframes. Session IDs and
  a per-consumer sequence expose reconnects and lost datagrams.
- A separate read-only timer derives closed 1m/5m/30m/1h/4h candle coverage,
  selected Pattern Forge shapes and EMA trends once per minute for the research
  watchlist. It has no broker credentials or order path; gaps prevent a frame
  from being manufactured or a trend from being calculated prematurely.
- The OCaml service was verified in `PAPER_ORDER` mode with `PAPER_ORDERS=1`
  on Dublin on 28 September 2026. The monitor is the freshest operational
  snapshot; any service check is only a point-in-time observation. It receives
  each quote and evaluates the cross-spread rule against a reference quote
  sampled at the earlier REST service's 30-second cadence. It records each
  sample and starts a separate worker for broker I/O on candidates so the feed
  receiver can continue. A deliberately simple, **uncalibrated** cross-spread
  price-move rule submits IOC limits only to the Alpaca **paper** origin.
- OCaml describes Alpaca closed-minute bars with selected Pattern Forge style
  EMA, RSI, MACD, Bollinger and candle-shape rules. A separate five-minute
  Alpaca historical snapshot supplies a more continuous, retrieval-timestamped
  context. Missing intervals reset indicators. These readings have no order
  authority and no calibrated probability; full cross-language parity with
  Pattern Forge remains unverified.
- Before every submission it checks paper account status and buying power,
  all open orders, the BTC position, and the BTC asset's price increment.
- An order journal is written before the API call. An ambiguous response
  blocks the next order until the previous client order ID is reconciled.
- A persistent ownership marker prevents the bot from selling a BTC position
  that predates its own buy. The current paper baseline is $100 per buy with a
  $500 BTC exposure ceiling. The requested $50 and $500 probability tiers are
  defined but cannot be selected until probabilities are calibrated. Repeated
  completed round trips have no daily turnover cap. These amounts supersede
  the earlier $2–$30 order and $300-per-bot guidance.
- Credentials are sent to `curl` through standard input rather than argv;
  credential variables are stripped from the child process environment.
- An append-only local journal records quotes, decisions and broker responses.
  New quote-cross decision events retain both bid/ask pairs and the exact
  trigger direction/margin; older orders without those fields are not
  reconstructed or presented as if their prices had been retained.
- `--research-once` reads closed BTC, ETH and SOL candles from Pattern Forge
  for descriptive 5m, 1h and 1d context. This path cannot authorize orders.
- Raw captures stay on Dublin; the public monitor receives signed summaries,
  BTC orders/fills and selected per-order journal events. Account-wide balances
  and unrelated holdings stay out of the public projection.
- `web/` contains the Vercel paper monitor. Dublin exports broker snapshots
  and the journal with Ed25519 signatures; Vercel never receives Alpaca keys.

The quote-cross strategy rule remains **uncalibrated**. The user specified the
new $100 baseline paper size on 27 September; neither its risk nor edge has
been calibrated. The requested Murphy/candlestick/Markov probability strategy
has no order authority yet. A [read-only Markov candle audit](research/markov_candle_audit.py)
measures next-bar transitions on Alpaca US BTC five-minute history and reports
its limits in [the evidence note](docs/pretrade-evidence.md). Between 08:36 and 10:26
UTC on 27 September, the earlier 30-second REST version sent 20 paper orders,
received 20 broker acknowledgements and reconciled all 20. It used
$299.999246395 of a then-active $300 daily buy-attempt budget; the broker later showed
zero BTC, no open order and the pre-existing 10 AAPL shares. The WebSocket
order path started at 13:00 UTC. An audit of 1,349 captured quotes from
13:16:05–13:38:43 UTC found zero crosses among adjacent quotes and six crosses
among 34 non-overlapping 30-second samples. This motivated restoring the
earlier diagnostic cadence on the WebSocket at 13:40 UTC; it is not an edge
estimate. A collector restart at 13:45:43 UTC produced a new session and a
fresh OCaml baseline. The next qualifying sample at 13:46:17 UTC led to an
Alpaca paper BTC/USD buy: the broker acknowledged it, reported a fill and no
open order, and OCaml reconciled it at 13:46:21 UTC. The public monitor showed
the same new order and fill in its 13:46:30 UTC snapshot. In this one cycle,
local receipt-to-decision was 7.409 ms, receipt-to-HTTP 1,302.796 ms, and the
HTTP round trip 316.036 ms. These are distinct measurements, not a latency
distribution or live-trading result. Pattern Forge and Energy Monitor remain descriptive context in
their own domains. See [the live-paper runbook](docs/LIVE-PAPER.md),
[the evidence and strategy limits](docs/pretrade-evidence.md), and the
[public HFT-lab plan](docs/PUBLIC-HFT-LAB-PLAN.md). The plan marks future work
and acceptance gates; it does not claim unbuilt steps are implemented.

## Build and test

```sh
opam install . --deps-only
opam exec -- dune build @all
opam exec -- dune runtest --force
opam exec -- dune exec bin/paper_crypto_main.exe -- --once
```

The `--once` mode reads one public quote and never places an order. On 27
September 2026, Alpaca accepted a BTC/USD IOC buy that was canceled after a
partial fill of 0.000000020 BTC; the net position was 0.000000019 BTC. Later
paper buys and sells were filled and reconciled. These are execution plumbing
checks, not performance results. The bot handles sub-$10 dust. The account's
existing 10-share AAPL position is outside its BTC/USD order path. The service
continues under the paper-only and per-position controls.

Paper fills are simulated and can differ from live execution. Even a working
paper order loop may lose money live after fees, spread, slippage, and adverse
selection.
